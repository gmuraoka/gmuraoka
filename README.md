### Hello there! ✌️

## I'm Gabriel Muraoka, 🇧🇷 Web Developer, currently in 🇵🇹.
> I am a full stack developer with over 10 years of experience in web projects, APIs and integrated systems, focusing on performance, scalability and integration between platforms. Throughout my career, I have worked in technology, education, tourism and tax companies, always aligning technology with the business. I have solid experience in system modernization projects, integration with external systems via APIs and WebServices, and legacy system maintenance. In addition to technical work, I have experience in project management, monitoring system implementation, user support and team training.
