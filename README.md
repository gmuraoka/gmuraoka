### Hello there! ✌️

## I'm Gabriel Muraoka, 🇧🇷 based Web Developer.
> Since 2012 I work with application development - mostly web tools. In 2015 I started my first degree: systems analysis and development. Because i like so much to develop, I delve into two crucial themes: user experience and usability of interfaces. I recently approached the business area through my second degree: accounting. Another topic that I am also interested in and started to seek knowledge is data science.I also have knowledge in PHP, C#, Python and JavaScript programming languages and MySQL, Oracle and MS-SQL databases.
